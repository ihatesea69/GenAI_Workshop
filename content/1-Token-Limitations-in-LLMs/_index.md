## Problem Statement
Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant constraints due to token limits, making it challenging to process extensive documents (e.g., 20-page reports) efficiently. This limitation affects the model's ability to understand and generate responses based on large contexts.

## Solution

### 1. "Divide and Conquer" Strategy
```python
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(
    separator="\n",
    chunk_size=512,
    chunk_overlap=50,
    length_function=len
)
```
- **Chunk Size**: 512 characters per chunk
- **Overlap**: 50 characters to maintain context continuity
- **Separator**: Newline character for natural breaks

### 2. Vector Storage Implementation
```python
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectorstore = FAISS.from_texts(chunks, embeddings)
```
- Uses OpenAI's embedding model
- FAISS for efficient similarity search
- In-memory vector storage for quick retrieval

### 3. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
```python
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=OpenAI(),
    chain_type="stuff",
    retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 3})
)
```
- Retrieves top 3 most relevant chunks
- Combines chunks for context-aware responses
- Uses OpenAI's LLM for response generation

## Features

### Document Processing
- Support for multiple file formats (TXT, PDF, DOCX)
- Document preview functionality
- Progress tracking during processing

### Query Processing
- Interactive question input
- Display of relevant document chunks
- AI-generated responses based on context

### User Interface
- Clean, intuitive Streamlit interface
- Progress indicators
- Expandable result sections

## Implementation Example

```python
# Document upload and processing
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("ðŸ“„ Upload your document", type=["txt", "pdf", "docx"])
if uploaded_file is not None:
    text = uploaded_file.read().decode("utf-8")
    
    # Chunk processing
    chunks = text_splitter.split_text(text)
    
    # Vector storage
    vectorstore = FAISS.from_texts(chunks, embeddings)
    
    # Query handling
    query = st.text_input("Ask your question:")
    if query:
        docs = vectorstore.similarity_search(query, k=3)
        response = qa_chain.run(query)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Preprocessing**
   - Clean and normalize text before chunking
   - Remove irrelevant content to optimize token usage
   - Maintain document structure where possible

2. **Chunking Strategy**
   - Adjust chunk size based on content type
   - Use appropriate overlap for context preservation
   - Consider semantic boundaries when possible

3. **Query Optimization**
   - Implement caching for frequent queries
   - Optimize number of retrieved chunks
   - Balance response quality with processing speed

## Performance Considerations

1. **Memory Usage**
   - Monitor vector store size
   - Implement batch processing for large documents
   - Clean up temporary storage

2. **Response Time**
   - Cache common queries
   - Optimize chunk retrieval
   - Balance chunk size with accuracy

3. **Accuracy**
   - Validate responses against source material
   - Adjust chunk size based on content complexity
   - Monitor and log retrieval quality

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Processing**
   - Support for more file formats
   - Improved chunking algorithms
   - Better handling of structured content

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Multi-document querying
   - Context-aware follow-up questions
   - Custom embedding models

3. **UI Enhancements**
   - Advanced visualization options
   - Batch processing capabilities
   - Enhanced error handling
